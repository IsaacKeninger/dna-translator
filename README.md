# Amino Acid Visualizer

This is a Python project that simulates transcription and translation of DNA into amino acids, and visualizes the results.

( This was created as a final project for my first coding class in college CS65! My favorite class of the semester It was amazing to touch up on my python skills
and to learn more introductory topics in comp sci.)

## Features

- Generates a random DNA sequence
- Transcribes DNA to RNA
- Translates RNA codons to amino acids
- Visualizes:
  - DNA strand with colored base pairs
  - Bar graph of amino acid frequencies

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `matplotlib` for graphing
- `tkinter` for GUI
- Dictionaries and list comprehensions
## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- matplotlib

## Credits

- Visualization adapted with help from ChatGPT
- String joining technique learned via GeeksForGeeks

## Usage

```bash
python dna-translator.py

or copy and paste code.
